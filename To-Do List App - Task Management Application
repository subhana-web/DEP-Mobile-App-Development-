How it Works
Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with details such as title, description, category, and due date.
Task Viewing: View tasks by category or due date. Completed tasks can be marked or archived.
Task Deletion: Delete tasks when no longer needed, with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.

Task Priority Levels: Adding levels to set high-priority or low-priority tasks.
Custom Themes: Implement light and dark themes based on user preference.
Conclusion
The To-Do List App is a robust and user-friendly application to manage daily tasks efficiently. I enjoyed building it, and future iterations will include additional features for enhanced usability.
